# Steven Snyder - Project Contributions Summary

## Programming
Initially I assumed the responsibility for the SMS portion of the project.  We were all unsure of how much work this would require.  That being said, once the functionality was setup and working, very little additional work was required.  This was especially true once we decided to only use the SMS feature as an alert system for our "drivers".  I did try to contribute more to the back end services but encountered difficulties catching up.


### SMS/Twilio 
* Research SMS service providers
* Integration of Twilio service 

### Driver Registration End Point
* End point for our driver registration

## Support
To make up for my smaller code contributions, I took on other responsibilities outside of writing code.  I took up anything that I thought would lighten the load of others.  Additionally I took on the responsibility of bug tester.  I drafted an easy to read and edit bug report that could be used by all team members to document and review any found bugs.  

### Bug Report
* Developed our bug reporting document for ease of use by all team members
* Searching and documenting bugs
* Helping identify priorities of bugs
* Developed a "Desired Feature" report for things that were not bugs but features that would be nice to have

### Validation Testing
* Tested the program at various stages and as new fixes were implemented

## Artifacts and Demonstrations
I helped out where ever I could or was asked to with all documents.  I took on the responsibility of drafting our demonstration process script and setup to optimize both time and showcasing of features.  Finally, I produced the video demonstration for our project's final demonstration.  

### Design & Design Document
* Helped with the overall design and required features 
* Helped with how the data flow would work 
* Business management portion and system behavior 
* Defined our validation standards

### Demonstrations
* Wrote the script for the first demonstration
* Produced the demonstration video for the final presentation
* Minor contributions to the slide show
