# Jake Schooley - Contributions Report Summary

## Programming

In the beginning I took up the responsiblity of creating the front-end of our application on Android Studio. We wanted this so we could
possibly put the application up Clover's app store. Through both inexperience in some areas on my part, progress was slowed and eventually
based on feedback and recommendations, it was decided as a group that we would instead make our project into a web application, which was 
already being developed for the driver side of the application. After some time of learning Python and HTML, I was then working on small 
functionality that was not already completed by my group members. This functionality was the Jobs with Associated Drivers and Confirmation 
Codes for Deregistration. Some of what was worked on was later edited by another group member. 

Here is a link to the Android Repo that was later scrapped: https://github.com/schooleyj/DispatcherClover

## Testing

I was involved in almost all sections of group testing that took place over the course of the semester. I worked with my group members to 
insure that our project ran smoothly and helped determine any bugs we had. I also did independent testing during my own time to make sure
that nothing changed while functionality was altered.

## Documentation

I documented most of the code that we had made, both Python and HTML, to make it easy to understand what each file and method did inside of
the project.

## Project Artifacts

I worked on sections of the Design Document, specifically, originally the android section(which had first drafts of how the
UI would appear), which was turned into just User Interface/Front End section. I also helped edit said Design Document to make sure it was
accurate and properly formatted.
I authored the Resolved/Unresolved Issues document.
I also assisted in developing the demonstration scripts and slideshow presentations.
