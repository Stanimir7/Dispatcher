# Justin Gavin - Project Contributions Summary
## Programming
There was not a part of the project as seen here that I was not involved with. I either authored the area, assisted the owner of/person responsible for the area, performed a bugfix, or took over development after the owner got stuck/deadline needed to be met. I was not involved with the now-dead/cut android app; aside from bug-fixing on one occasion. 

The commit history/file modification history is fairly accurate and reflects contribution. Any commits that were mix-ups are marked as such.

To summarize the areas that are almost entirely my work: 

* DB design/creation/programming (all stored procedures, tables, relationships, etc)
* Frontend design and implementation. Fully implemented using the Materialize.CSS web framework. Lots of javascript, AJAX requests, etc. Lots of template creation using the Jinja2 engine.
* Backend: Lots of work here; most of not all of the endpoints driving the UI receiving AJAX requests, etc. Too much to list off, see the commit history.

  
## System Administration
Functioned as the Linux sysadmin. Perfomed lots of tasks on AWS server, configuring and supporting the software we built upon: UNIX user permission maintenance, Apache HTTPD config, the Apache module mod_wsgi config, MySQL DB admin, php, etc. Also developed and shared a VM that functioned as a development copy of the server for the group to use; duplicated admin tasks on the VM image and distributed. 


## Scrum Master-ing
Facilitated the functioning of the group, scheduling, communication with the instructor, etc. Maintained meeting summaries, notes, status logs, etc.


## Project Artifacts
