#Python Backend Logic
As the project first began, we wanted to get the lowest amount of funcionality to begin. We divided it up into
sections, I was one responsible for the Backend logic that we decided to code in python. I worked with Stanimir
to get the basic funtionality of our project working before we started to work on implementing individual endpoints. 

#Design Doc
I worked on writing the explanations for the python backend in Section 3 of the Design Document, as well as making the 
UML Diagram for Registering a new driver into the system. I also wrote the description of our Prototype, and what we 
intended it to be able to do. 

#Register Business Endpoint
With the basic functionality of the project implemented, we divided up endpoints so that each of us could flesh one out to
get the project working properly. I worked on getting the Business registration endpoint completed to allow a new business 
to register themselves for our service and be added into our system. 

#Business Manage Job
The next enpoint I was responsible for completing was to write the logic to allow the business to manage the current jobs;
to be able to mark them as complete, or to cancel them completely, and to send a tezt to any driver associated with that job
that it is now unavailable. 

#Create Job Autofill
With our prject now completely functional, we reached a polishing phase to work on some stretch goals and minor adjustments. 
During this I added an autofill feature that automatically filled in the business's phone number and home location when creating
a new job so that they wouldn't have to continuously fill out the same information over and over again.
