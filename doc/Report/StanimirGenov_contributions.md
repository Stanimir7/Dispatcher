##Python Backend
As the project began, Sean and I worked on the same endpoint for the demo. As the project continued from there,
we split up and worked on seperate endpoints and helped each other out where the logic was similar.

##Driver Job Management
Most of my work was on the endpoints and logic with how the driver claims, cancels, and completes jobs. 
This includes most of the HTML templates that are used in those endpoints. As what the driver presses and how that calls 
a certain endpoint with specific parameters is highly interlinked.

##Design Doc
On the Design Doc I created most of the UML diagrams and explained the logic behind them. I also explained how our
application was RESTful and how the use of Flask ties in with that. As well as multiple places in Section 3 of explaining 
the backend logic, specifically after the midterm evaluation when we had a better grasp of how everything will end up.
