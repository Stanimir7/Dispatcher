# Unresolved Issues:
* Deregistering Drivers: When deregistering with either Dispatcher or a business, a driver will be asked to enter their associated phone number. After, they will receive a text containing a confirmation code. If they enter the confirmation code incorrectly, they will be brought back to the phone number input screen. This is slightly cumbersome, as they will then have to enter their phone number again, receive a different confirmation code, and input the code. Not a bug, a ‘would be nice’ feature.
* Business with no Current Drivers: Informing a business when they create a job if have no drivers to complete said job. Less an issue, more of a ‘would be nice’ feature.
* Drivers with Associated Jobs: When a driver cancels on a job, if that job is later completed and the business views the details of the job, there is no distinction made between the driver that completed the  job and the driver that claimed the job and backed out. We simply display “associated drivers”. Would be nice to include the information in the display.
