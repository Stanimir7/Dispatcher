## Notes
The code documentation for SQL stored procedures can be browsed by opening the MySQL workbench model file (doc/Dispatcher.mwb) and viewing the comments section. These comments are synchronized to the actual DB (and therefore are useful during development); but do not show when exporting the model via the "Forward Engineer SQL Create Script" utility. This means that they cannot be seen in the (doc/db_create.sql) plaintext file.
